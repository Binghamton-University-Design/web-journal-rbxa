					<h2>Project 2: Icons</h2>
					<p><img src="images/round-rect-icons.png" style="width:427px"></p>
					<p>The most challenging aspect of this project was keeping the icons simple and scalable, yet still interesting and visually appealing. Once I came up with the rounded rectangle theme, it became easier. Some common elements tying the icons together as a set are: shapes simplified to rectangles, rounded corners, consistent spacing between rectangles, diagonal rectangles, single open red rectangle, stroke color and weight, and consistent colors.

					<h2>Project 1: 
						Isometric Avatar</h2>
					<p><img src="images/Rebecca avatar isometric smol-02.png"></p>
					<p>Using the isometric grid, I used Adobe Illustrator to create this avatar. Typically in Illustrator, I use the pen tool but I opted for the pencil tool for this project because I wanted more natural, flowing lines to give it a more organic feel. I tried to stick to a muted color palette because I usually wear those colors, and it gives the design a more cohesive look. My favorite part is the little bit on top of the beret which I drew as a tiny floating circle.

					<p><img src="images/rebeccapic.JPG"></p>
					<p>I have stolen chocolate back from evil little brothers. I walked around the town of Fairport. I have spent the night with Lauren Kidd and left with both my sanity and my life. I was accepted to the University at the normal age that most people are allowed in. I tread paths by daylight that others often speak of during the day. I have talked to myself, loved puppies, and arranged songs that make the critiquers weep. My name is Rebecca. You may have heard of me.
